<h3 class="paragraph">I am a good learner with creativity sense, problem solving techniques and able to learn new things. I have always been deeply interested in IT field from early age. I am new learner in this field as i could not get enough knowledge about it in my high school. So, as a new learner i was facing problem in coding, web development, designing and debugging. I have gained basic knowledge in those topics within my 1st term.This is my first web page and i have learned many things from my mistakes too. I tried my best to make this web page and Mr.Ankit Thapa really has helped to solve my problems. I have learned about web development through internet also. I am glad to present my first web page and promise to get better at it.   </h3>
